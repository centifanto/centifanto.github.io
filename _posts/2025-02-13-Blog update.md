On my original (hosted on Blogger...so 2010's), I had a fair amount of technical posts, but I was not happy with the quality, nor the content (as they were more related to my on-prem work that I started my tech career in), so I nuked them when I migrated over to GitHub pages to start fresh. I seriously keep meaning to post content related to my Cloud/DevOps day job, but between work and personal obligations I have not manage to make the time. Fingers crossed this will be the year I actually put out some technical content. It will come off the press slower as these subjects are far more technical than the personal/hobby tech posts I currently have here, and I can be a perfectionist so I don't haphazardly write. It's a very intentional process for me as well as time consuming to make sure it's accurate and relevant.

I have some low hanging fruit topics around my favorite apps I use everyday, [Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), so I might try and push those out so I can get something posted before the next ice age, and maybe get some rhythm and motivation to post more technical content.
